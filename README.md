HISTORY APP 

Introduction of the history app 

 

My research on the history app is that I was able to find 10 dead people who have lived from the past. Throughout history there have been many people who have had a lasting impact on the world. Some of these individuals have changed the course of this history through their actions, while others have left behind a legacy that has shaped our understanding from the past. In this report we going to discuss and discover the lives and legacies of the 10 famous historical figures who died in the past using a Kotlin generated app (android studio). We are going to discuss and discover people who went from being political leaders to artists. Each of the leaders or individuals made a profound impact on the world and their history deserves to be told. The study of history is important for understanding the present and shaping the future of the world. By exploring the lives of historical figures, we gain more insight into the events and ideas that have shaped our world. We will be discussing the 10 different individuals who are famous and have had an enormous impact on our lives and a lasting impact on history from ancient to modern times. By understanding their stories, we can learn about the different things they have done in history (what did they change or create in the world), we can gain more insight into the values and beliefs that have shaped our society and discover the challenges and opportunities that we face today. In this report we will learn about what the history app is for (the importance or the use of it) and the 10 different people I have chosen and their history (what they have done in the past, whereas to this day they are still being spoken about or educated about).  The history app is a digital platform aimed at providing users with an immersive experience in exploring historical events, figures, and facts. GitHub, along with GitHub Actions, has been instrumental in the development, deployment, and maintenance of this application. This report outlines the comprehensive utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions throughout the development lifecycle of the history app. 

 

 

The history app is designed to provide users with an understanding, interactive exploration of the historical figures and the ideas that have shaped their lives. The app is intended to be an educational tool with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for people of all ages and backgrounds to discover or explore the past. The app will feature a searchable database of the historical figures with detailed information and images. The history app I made, you will be able to calculate any number you have inputted, and it will give you an answer. You start by inputting the age of a certain individual who has lived in the ancient and/or modern times and the emulator will give you the history of a specific individual (what they have been through, what did they do in the past and what did they change or create in the past). The history app will take a person’s age as input and then match the age of the 10 different people in history when they passed away; it will also help Sarah’s learners to learn in a more fun and productive way since Sarah is an avid history buff and educator who wants to use technology to inspire young minds.   

When it comes to historical figures from modern times, Nelson Mandela is one of the most influential people of the 20th century. He was a political leader, activist and philanthropist who played a significant role in the ending apartheid in South Africa. He spent 27 years in prison for his political beliefs and they went on to become the first democratically elected president of South Africa. During his presidency, he worked to rebuild the country and promote national unity. He was a strong advocate for human rights and was awarded the “Nobel Peace Prize” in 1993. Even after his presidency, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela continued to be an influential figure and was often referred to. 

Albert Einstein is one of the second most influential scientists of all time, and his theories have profoundly impacted our understanding of the universe. He is best known for his theory, which revolutionized our understanding of space and time. He also made important contributions to quantum theory and his work helped lay the foundation for modern physics. Albert Einstein was a famous physicist. His research spanned from quantum mechanics to theories about gravity and motion. After publishing some groundbreaking papers, Einstein toured the world and gave speeches about his discoveries. In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his discovery of the photoelectric effect.  Albert Einstein was also a great humanitarian, and he used his fame to speak out against fascism and racism. He was a vocal supporter of the civil rights and the human rights, and he even helped establish the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). After World War II, he campaigned for nuclear disarmament, and he was a strong advocate for peace. 

The GitHub utilization for history app project repository is organized into several directories including frontend, backend, documentation, and tests. A Git Flow branching model is adopted, consisting of main, development, and feature branches to manage code changes effectively.  All code changes are proposed via pull requests, facilitating code review, and ensuring the quality of contributions. GitHub Issues are utilized for tracking bugs, feature requests, and other tasks. Labels and milestones help in prioritizing and categorizing issues. GitHub's built-in code review features enable team members to review and provide feedback on code changes before merging. GitHub Actions are employed for automating the CI process, ensuring that code changes are tested and verified before merging into the GitHub Actions workflows are configured for deploying the history app to staging and production environments automatically after successful CI checks. 

GitHub and GitHub Actions play a crucial role in the development lifecycle of the History App, offering robust version control, collaboration, and automation capabilities. By leveraging these tools effectively, the project team ensures efficient development, testing, and deployment processes, delivering a high-quality and reliable application to users.
